They provide various range of home decor products such as furnniture, wallpaper, turf related products for outdoor and indoor as well, etc. They also provide variety of services like interior design services, custom design services, installation services. I am going to use CRUD function for this company to create the project.

Technologies used:-
In frontend I have used HTML, CSS, Java Script.
In backend I have used JSON file to store product data and that data is fetched through API by using Python with the framework of flask.


For testing:- 
  Login testing: I have created Admin Login, by that login credentials admin can perform CRUD function i.e., as follows:-
     Create= Admin can add a new product
     Read= Fetches all existing products
     Update= Admin can modify/edit the existing product list by entering the product id
     Delete= Admin can delete existing products list by entering the product id.

  Project testing: All files are tested and they are integrated as per the requirement of the project.

NOTE= All product data is stored in json file.
