Description of the Project: Anjani furnishing is a home decoor and furnishing company which is located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. They provide various range of home decor products such as furnniture, wallpaper, turf related products for outdoor and indoor as well, etc. They also provide variety of servies like interior design services, custom design services, installation services. They do have a website but they are unable to manage the customers information efficiently, so CRM will help them and to manage the best selling items or favorite by customers or liked by their clients, so I have an idea to create a sales dashboard.
