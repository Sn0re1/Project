I am going to use CRUD function for this company.


Technologies used:-
In frontend I have used two files of HTML named (login.html & project.html and both of these HTML files consists of embedded CSS & JS).
In backend I have used  two files one of them is JSON file to store product data which is named as products.json and other file where data is fetched using API by Python with the framework of flask and that file is named as app.py.


Features:-
     Create= Admin can add a new product
     Read= Fetches all existing products
     Update= Admin can modify/edit the existing product list by entering the product id
     Delete= Admin can delete existing products list by entering the product id.


For testing:- 
  Login testing: I have created Admin Login, by that login credentials admin can perform CRUD function. 
  Project testing: All files are tested and they are integrated as per the requirement of the project. All files including html and json and python files are tested and are also working properly.
